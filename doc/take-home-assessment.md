# Google Maps API Key Rotation with Azure Key Vault

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing an automated process to rotate a Google Maps API key and securely store the updated key in an Azure Key Vault secret named GoogleMapKey. The goal is to enhance security by regularly changing the API key without disrupting services that rely on it. These services have both APIs and CLI tools. You may use either for this exercise, but you may find the CLIs easier to use in your scripts.

## Requirements

1. GitHub Actions Script: Write a GitHub Actions workflow that accomplishes the following steps:
    - Retrieve the existing Google Maps API key or service key needed to interact with Google Maps APIs
    - Generate a new API key (rotation).
    - Store the new API key securely in the Azure Key Vault secret GoogleMapKey.
2. Documentation and Explanation:
    - At Hyperproof we maintain operational documentation for running our services. Document anything necessary for other engineers to understand how to operate, maintain, and possibly enhance your solution.
    - Disclosure of AI Tools: You may use AI tools or external resources. However, you must disclose any tools you used and provide a summary of the benefits and drawbacks encountered during their implementation.
